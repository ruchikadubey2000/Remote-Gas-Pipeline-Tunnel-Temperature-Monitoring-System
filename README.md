# Remote-Gas-Pipeline-Tunnel-Temperature-Monitoring-System
The leading engineering and system integration providers needed exactly the right solution for a challenging gas pipeline application. In the confined space of a tunnel, temperature rises easily, and the overheating could cause pipeline fractures that could lead to gas leaks or even explosions. This may cause loss of property and human loss, so in order to overcome that a remote monitoring system is designed. To monitor the temperature parameters at various places routers can be placed which consists of the temperature sensor to monitor temperature, gas sensor and pressure sensors to detect any gas leakage along with NODE MCU These routers can send the data to the IBM cloud .the data is then visualized on the web app or mobile app from where the desired persons can monitor and take necessary actions when needed. Notifications can also be sent if there are any extreme conditions using the mobile app.
